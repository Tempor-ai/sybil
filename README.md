### How to Contribute

1) Create your new branch from the existing **develop** branch (not from **main** or any of the staging branches). The **develop** branch contains the up-to-date code for SYBIL needed to branch off of.
2) As this is your branch, feel free to commit and push in your code however you like. Also, be sure to frequently merge _from_ the **develop** branch, in case there are any new updates in the **develop** branch.
3) If you want to integrate into the greater source code, move your code into one of the four directories: **src**, **test**, **examples**, and **datasets**. If the directory does not exist in the existing source code, feel free to create that directory. 
4) Once you feel like your branch is ready to be integrated, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge into your respective milestone staging branch. For example, **m2_staging** or **m3_staging**.
5) Address any comments for feedback for PR until the reviewer approves. The reviewer will then merge your branch with the respective staging branch.
6) Once we have completed a certain milestone, we will release that milestone's staging branch to **main** branch, which is used for user acceptance if not for production.
