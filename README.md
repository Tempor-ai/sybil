### How to Contribute

1) Create your new branch from the existing **develop** branch (not from **main** or any of the staging branches). The **develop** branch contains the up-to-date code for SYBIL needed to branch off of.
2) As this is your branch, feel free to commit and push in your code however you like. Also, be sure to frequently merge _from_ the **develop** branch, in case there are any new updates in the **develop** branch.
3) Once you feel like your branch is ready to be integrated into the greater source code, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge into your respective milestone staging branch. For example, **m2_staging** or **m3_staging**.
4) Address any comments for feedback for PR until the reviewer approves. The reviewer will then merge your branch with the respective staging branch.
5) Once we have completed a certain milestone, we will release that milestone's staging branch to **main** branch, which is used for user acceptance if not for production.
